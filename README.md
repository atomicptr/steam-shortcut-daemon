# steam-shortcut-daemon

A daemon which watches the Start Menu folder of Steam and adds Windows 10 compatible shortcuts on the fly.

## Download

[Download the latest version here](https://github.com/kasoki/steam-shortcut-daemon/releases/latest)

## Why?

The Windows 10 start menu sadly can't process "Internet Shortcuts" anymore which means that you can't pin or search for your Steam games in the new start menu.

This application fixes that problem.
